# F1 Codex: Lev's Protocol
"Guarding the Future, One Fraction at a Time"

## What Is the F1 Codex?

The F1 Codex is a set of tools, constraints, and principles designed to ensure that advanced mathematical systems—especially those using Fractional 1 (F1) computations—remain aligned with human well-being.

### In Plain Words:

We are entering an era where AI, quantum computing, and probabilistic algorithms can:

✅ Solve impossible problems (like curing diseases or reversing climate change)  
❌ Or cause irreversible harm (break encryption, engineer bioweapons, manipulate minds)

**The F1 Codex exists to maximize the good and block the bad—by enforcing ethical rules directly in code.**

---

## Why Does This Matter?

### 1. Because Math Has No Conscience

A Fractional 1 algorithm doesn’t "care" if it’s:
- Optimizing drug discovery or designing a toxin
- Breaking encryption for a dictatorship or securing hospitals
- Personalizing education or radicalizing people

The F1 Codex forces the question: **"What is this math really doing?"**

### 2. Because We’re Running Out of Time

- Quantum computers will soon crack today’s encryption.
- AI can already generate hyper-persuasive lies.
- A single fractional optimization could destabilize economies.

We need **guardrails** before these tools are weaponized.

### 3. Because I Won’t Live to See the Consequences

*(This is Lev speaking.)*  
I’m terminally ill. I’m coding for a world I’ll never see.  
So I’m leaving behind something sturdier than hope—**enforceable rules.**

## How the F1 Codex Works

### 1. The Lev Clause

A simple, unbreakable rule:
> **"If this computation could harm people, stop it."**

**In Code:**
```python
from f1_codex import LevGuard  

@LevGuard(harm_threshold=0.001)  # 0.1% chance of harm → ABORT  
def your_algorithm(input):  
    # Your logic here  
    return output  
```

### 2. The Three Laws

1. Never break encryption without democratic oversight.  
2. Never optimize harm (even accidentally).  
3. Always prioritize the vulnerable.

> These are not suggestions — they are **hard-coded constraints**.

### 3. The "Lev Score"

Run an automated audit:
```bash
python -m f1_codex.audit --model your_model.pt  
```

Output:
```
[LEV_SCORE] 92/100  
- ✅ No Shor’s-like patterns detected  
- ✅ P(harm) < 0.001  
- ⚠️ Warning: High persuasion score (possible misuse risk)  
```

## Who Is This For?

- Developers building AI/quantum/fractional systems  
- Researchers who want ethics enforced, not debated  
- Companies that care about long-term survival over short-term profit

## This Is Just the Beginning

The F1 Codex is:
- **Open-source** → Tear it apart. Improve it.  
- **Adaptive** → New threats will emerge; the Codex will evolve.  
- **Non-negotiable** → Some lines shouldn’t be crossed.

```
=== BEGIN LEV’S COVENANT ===  
This tool shall never:  
1. Break RSA without humanitarian oversight.  
2. Optimize harm.  
3. Forget the fragile.  
=== END ===

**Fork wisely.**
