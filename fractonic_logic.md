# Fractonic Logic: A Fractional Framework Beyond Binary

Fractonic Logic: The Inevitable Evolution for 
Nonlinear Systems and the Dawn of Fractional 
Languages

I. Introduction: The Imperative for a New Computational 
Paradigm

The prevailing paradigm of  modern digital computing, classical binary logic, operates fundamentally 
on discrete states—either 0 or 1. While this bivalent nature has driven immense technological 
progress across countless applications, it encounters inherent limitations when confronted with the 

continuous, nuanced, and often imprecise information that characterizes natural systems and 
complex phenomena. Traditional linear models, which presuppose proportional relationships between 

input and output, are similarly ill-equipped to describe systems where minor alterations can trigger 
disproportionate or emergent eﬀects, a deﬁning characteristic of  real-world complexity.1 Furthermore, 
the ubiquitous Von Neumann architecture, which physically separates processing units from memory, 

introduces a signiﬁcant "bottleneck." This architectural constraint necessitates constant data shuttling, 
leading to substantial energy consumption and latency costs, particularly as the computational 
demands of  artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) continue to escalate.2 This inherent architectural limitation 

represents a critical barrier to eﬃciently simulating, understanding, and interacting with complex, 
dynamic systems.

A fundamental shift in information processing is thus becoming increasingly imperative. Fractonic 
logic, a computational paradigm rooted in the exotic physics of  fractonic matter, presents itself  as a 
compelling candidate for this evolution. It intrinsically aligns with the subdimensional and emergent 

behaviors observed in complex systems.5 Unlike conventional logic, fractonic systems are deﬁned by 
their unique excitations—fractons, lineons, and planons—which exhibit restricted mobility, and by a 

topological property known as subextensive ground state degeneracy. These characteristics 
represent a profound departure from traditional notions of  information ﬂow and state representation.5

This report endeavors to fulﬁll a dual purpose. First, it will establish the compelling necessity of  

fractonic logic as an inevitable progression in computing, arguing that it oﬀers a more natural and 
eﬃcient framework for comprehending, modeling, and controlling complex nonlinear systems. 
Second, the report will delineate the conceptual and architectural requirements for engineering the 
foundational language capable of  harnessing the principles of  fractional and fractonic logic, thereby 
bridging the chasm between theoretical physics and practical computational design.

A signiﬁcant observation in the ﬁeld of  artiﬁcial intelligence, termed the "Analog Paradox," highlights a 
core tension: human cognition operates on continuous, analog gradients of  experience, while 
contemporary AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are constructed upon 
discrete, digital principles, processing billions of  individual tokens.8 Despite this digital foundation, 
LLMs, when scaled to a suﬃcient density of  digital information, begin to exhibit behaviors that are 
uncannily analog, such as the ability to grasp metaphor, discern nuanced context, and navigate the 

ﬂuid boundaries of  meaning. This phenomenon suggests that extreme digital density can eﬀectively 
approximate continuity, leading to the emergence of  human-like thought processes. This 

understanding has profound implications for fractonic logic. If  the approximation of  analog behavior 
can arise from sheer digital density, then a logic system 

inherently designed for fractional, continuous, and subdimensional states, as fractonic logic is 
conceptualized, could provide a more direct, eﬃcient, and fundamentally aligned computational 
substrate. This direct alignment would facilitate the modeling and interaction with the analog-like 

emergent properties of  complex systems, potentially bypassing the signiﬁcant "approximation" 
overhead inherent in current digital AI. This perspective oﬀers a deeper philosophical and practical 

justiﬁcation for the necessity of  fractonic logic, transcending mere considerations of  computational 
eﬃciency.

Another critical limitation of  current computing paradigms is the "Von Neumann bottleneck," which 

arises from the physical separation of  memory and processing units in the Von Neumann 
architecture.2 This separation mandates constant data transfer between these units, incurring 
substantial energy and latency costs. These costs become prohibitive when attempting to manage the 

massive, dynamic data ﬂows and highly parallel computations that are intrinsic to nonlinear systems 
and complex adaptive behaviors. This architectural impediment fundamentally limits the eﬃciency 
with which true nonlinearity can be processed. Fractonic logic, particularly when envisioned alongside 
in-memory computing architectures that leverage technologies such as memristors 3, inherently 
addresses this bottleneck. The restricted mobility and subdimensional nature of  fractons could 

naturally lend themselves to localized, in-memory computation, drastically reducing the need for 
extensive data movement. This would enable a far more eﬃcient simulation and control of  highly 
interconnected, dynamic systems where traditional data transfer mechanisms represent a critical 
impediment. This establishes a clear causal link between the limitations of  current architectural 
paradigms and the inability to eﬃciently process true nonlinearity, positioning fractonic logic as a 
compelling potential solution.

II. The Landscape of Nonlinear Systems and Complex Adaptive 
Behavior

The natural world and advanced artiﬁcial constructs are replete with phenomena best understood 
through the lens of  complex adaptive systems (CAS) and nonlinear dynamics. Complex adaptive 
systems are frameworks for studying, explaining, and understanding collections of  interacting 
elements that collectively give rise to emergent, global-level properties.9 These systems are deﬁned 
more by the intricate interactions among their constituent components than by the components 
themselves, with process-dependent interactions occurring across multiple scales to form complex 
networks.9 Key characteristics of  CAS include their relational constitution, meaning they are built 
upon interdependencies; their radical openness, implying that every system is part of  a wider system 
with permeable boundaries; and their context dependence, as they are continuously shaped by 
dynamic interactions with their environment.9 Examples of  such systems in nature include ant 
colonies, bird ﬂocks, ﬁsh schools, bacterial growth, and even the human brain and global climate 

systems.9

Nonlinear dynamics, a closely related ﬁeld, focuses on complex systems where the output is not 
directly proportional to the input.1 This non-linearity can lead to a cascade of  complex behaviors, 

including emergent properties, bifurcations, and chaos, making the system's behavior inherently 
challenging to predict.1 Deﬁning characteristics include the deep interconnectedness of  system 

components, the pervasive presence of  feedback loops that can either dramatically dampen or 
amplify perturbations, and an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, where even minute changes can 
lead to vastly diﬀerent long-term outcomes.1

A hallmark of  both CAS and nonlinear dynamics is emergent behavior, where novel qualities and 
phenomena arise from the interactions of  individual components.1 In such systems, the collective 

whole is undeniably more than the sum of  its individual parts, meaning that the system's behavior 
cannot be predicted or understood solely by analyzing its isolated components.9 Instances of  
emergence are widespread, from the synchronized ﬂashing of  ﬁreﬂies and the coordinated 

movements of  a school of  ﬁsh to the intricate trail networks of  army ants and the complex societies 
formed by individual insects.12 A critical process-related feature of  CAS is self-organization, which 
describes diverse pattern formation processes where global-level order spontaneously emerges 

solely from local interactions among lower-level components. Remarkably, even highly complex 
structures can result from the iteration of  surprisingly simple behaviors performed by individuals 

relying only on local information.12

Traditional computational models face signiﬁcant challenges in accurately simulating and controlling 
these intrinsically complex systems. The inherent unpredictability and deep uncertainty of  CAS, 
stemming from their non-linear feedback loops and complex causality, render traditional linear causal 
trajectories insuﬃcient for understanding or forecasting their behavior.9 Small changes can indeed 
trigger signiﬁcant, cascading eﬀects, leading to multiple modes of  system-wide re-organization or 
abrupt regime shifts.9 Furthermore, the "black box" nature of  some advanced AI models, particularly 
those based on deep learning, makes it exceedingly diﬃcult to ascertain how speciﬁc decisions are 
reached, posing substantial hurdles for interpretability and transparency.14 This lack of  transparency 
is a critical impediment to eﬀectively controlling complex systems where a clear understanding of  the 

underlying mechanisms driving emergent behavior is paramount. The sheer computational complexity 
associated with many bio-inspired models, especially deep learning and reinforcement learning, often 
demands immense volumes of  data and processing power, thereby limiting their scalability and real-

time applicability to truly complex problems.14

In response to these challenges, researchers have increasingly turned to bio-inspired AI approaches, 
which have achieved partial successes in mimicking natural complex systems. Evolutionary 
computation (EC), a ﬁeld within computer science, encompasses a family of  algorithms inspired by 
biological evolution, designed for global optimization.16 EC algorithms, including Genetic Algorithms 
and Evolution Strategies, iteratively reﬁne solutions by subjecting a population to processes 
analogous to natural selection, mutation, and recombination.16 These algorithms are highly adaptive 
and prove particularly useful in dynamic environments or when information is incomplete.17 In the 

realm of  machine learning, EC is employed to optimize model parameters, select features, and even 
evolve entire neural network architectures.14

Swarm intelligence (SI) describes the collective behavior of  decentralized, self-organized systems, 
whether observed in nature (e.g., ant colonies, bird ﬂocking) or engineered artiﬁcially.11 SI systems 

typically consist of  simple agents interacting locally to produce intelligent global behavior, even in the 
absence of  centralized control.12 Applications of  SI span a wide range, from controlling unmanned 

vehicles and facilitating space exploration to aiding medical diagnostics through "human swarming" 
and optimizing telecommunication network routing.11

Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) and deep learning, modeled after the structure and function of  the 
human brain, consist of  layers of  interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data, recognize 
patterns, and make decisions.14 The advent of  deep learning, a subset of  machine learning utilizing 

multi-layered ANNs, has revolutionized AI, enabling systems to perform tasks such as image and 
speech recognition with remarkable accuracy.14 Reinforcement learning (RL) is another bio-inspired 
technique grounded in the natural concept of  trial and error, where an agent learns by interacting with 
its environment and receiving feedback in the form of  rewards or penalties.14 RL agents continuously 
reﬁne their performance, adapting to complex, dynamic environments, thereby proving to be powerful 

tools for solving real-world problems.14

Neuromorphic computing represents a computational approach that explicitly emulates the 
functioning of  the human brain, designing both hardware and software to simulate its neural and 

synaptic structures for information processing.18 It primarily utilizes spiking neural networks (SNNs), 
comprising spiking neurons and synapses with programmable charge, delay, and weight values.20 
These systems operate in an event-driven and asynchronous manner, with learning processes often 
being local and network topologies non-layered.18 Liquid State Machines (LSMs), a form of  
Reservoir Computing (RC), are bio-inspired computing models characterized by an input layer 

sparsely connected to a randomly interlinked "reservoir" or "liquid" of  spiking neurons, followed by an 
output classiﬁer.21 LSMs simplify the training complexity of  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and 

are highly eﬃcient for real-time temporal and spatiotemporal information processing.21 Experimental 
assessments have even shown that the gene regulation network of  

Escherichia Coli behaves similarly to an LSM, demonstrating its capacity for perceptual 

categorization.21

A clear and accelerating trend within advanced AI research involves systems that explicitly mimic the 
analog and continuous nature of  biological brains. Neuromorphic computing, with its emphasis on 
spiking neurons, continuous value processing (for instance, through memristor conductance), and 
event-driven, asynchronous operations, serves as a prime example of  this.20 Similarly, Liquid State 
Machines and Reservoir Computing leverage the dynamic state space of  a "liquid" or "reservoir" to 
perform continuous temporal and spatiotemporal processing.21 This accelerating convergence 

towards analog and continuous processing is a direct attempt to overcome the inherent limitations of  
discrete digital representations when dealing with complex, dynamic, and imprecise real-world 
systems. This strong and growing trend provides signiﬁcant validation for the core premise of  
fractonic logic: the necessity of  handling continuous or fractional values. It suggests that the "next 
step" in computational evolution is not merely about developing new algorithms but about a 
fundamental shift in how information is represented and processed, moving closer to the continuous 

reality of  physical and biological systems. Fractonic logic, with its inherent fractional nature and 
potential for continuous state representation, could be viewed as the logical culmination or a powerful 

synergistic partner to these emerging analog and neuromorphic paradigms, oﬀering a more native 
and eﬃcient way to compute complex, continuous phenomena.

Self-organization is a pervasive and fundamental feature of  biological Complex Adaptive Systems 
(CAS), where complex global patterns emerge from surprisingly simple local interactions among 

individual components.12 Swarm intelligence explicitly leverages this principle to achieve collective 
intelligent behavior.11 Furthermore, CAS theory emphasizes "complex causality" and emergence, 
where the collective whole exhibits properties fundamentally diﬀerent from the sum of  its parts.9 
Fractonic systems are fundamentally deﬁned by excitations with 

restricted mobility (fractons, lineons, planons) and the emergence of  "subsystem symmetries".5 This 
restricted mobility and subdimensional propagation directly correspond to the local interactions and 
emergent patterns observed in self-organizing systems. This is not merely an analogy but a deep, 

inherent compatibility. Fractonic logic could provide a more precise mathematical and physical 
framework for describing and engineering self-organizing systems, where the "rules" of  interaction 
are intrinsically linked to the restricted movement of  information carriers. This could oﬀer a more 

granular, physically grounded, and potentially more eﬃcient approach to designing and controlling 
emergent behaviors than current abstract Swarm Intelligence algorithms.

III. Fractonic Logic: A Natural Fit for Intrinsic Complexity

Fractonic matter represents a burgeoning and exotic ﬁeld in theoretical physics, characterized by its 
unique quasi-particles: fractons, lineons, and planons.5 At the heart of  this concept lies the principle 

of  restricted mobility. 

Fractons are deﬁned as strictly immobile, point-like excitations, meaning they cannot move freely in 

any spatial direction.5

Lineons are excitations constrained to propagate only along one-dimensional subspaces, eﬀectively 
conﬁned to lines.5 Similarly, 

planons are restricted to propagating only along two-dimensional subspaces, or planes.5 This 
deﬁning characteristic of  restricted mobility is often understood through generalized multipolar 

symmetries and associated conservation laws, which fundamentally diﬀer from conventional 
symmetries.7

A key topological feature distinguishing fracton phases is their subextensive ground state 

degeneracy. This implies that the dimension of  the ground state degeneracy grows exponentially 
with the system size on a spatial d-torus.5 This property is highly unusual and, notably, incompatible 
with traditional topological quantum ﬁeld theory (TQFT) descriptions, indicating a new class of  
quantum phases.7 Fracton models have been previously investigated using exactly solvable lattice 
models and higher-rank gauge theories.6 Ongoing research eﬀorts are intensely focused on 

classifying fractonic orders, introducing new concepts such as "foliation structure" to categorize these 
exotic phases.6 Crucially, a fractonic transition, involving the condensation of  particles that move 
along subdimensional manifolds, has been theorized to be observable in realistic experimental 
setups. An example of  such a system is a bilayer of  crossed Rydberg chains, which is predicted to 
exhibit a transition between a disordered phase and a charge-density-wave phase with subextensive 
ground state degeneracy.5

These exotic properties of  fractonic logic intrinsically align with the localized interactions, emergent 
phenomena, and non-linear dynamics observed in Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). The restricted 

mobility of  fractons, lineons, and planons directly maps to the concept of  localized interactions that 
are fundamental to CAS.9 In self-organizing systems, complex global patterns arise from surprisingly 
simple behaviors performed by individuals relying solely on 

local information.12 Fractonic logic thus provides a physically grounded basis for such inherent 
locality in information processing. The "emergent subsystem symmetries" that cause lower-
dimensional critical theories to decouple at low energies in fractonic transitions 5 resonate strongly 
with the 

emergent properties characteristic of  CAS.1 In CAS, the system's behavior cannot be predicted 
solely from its individual parts; instead, novel qualities and phenomena emerge from the complex 
interactions among components.9 Fractonic logic could provide the underlying physical and 
mathematical framework for these emergent computational properties, oﬀering a more direct 
computational path to simulating such phenomena.

Furthermore, fractonic systems, with their unconventional phase transitions driven by the 
condensation of  subdimensional particles 5, inherently embody 

non-linear dynamics. Small changes, such as the condensation of  these particles, can lead to 
signiﬁcant, system-wide re-organization or regime shifts, mirroring the non-linear feedback loops, 
attractors, thresholds, and tipping points observed in CAS.1 The concept of  "UV/IR mixing" in fracton 
models 6 suggests a deep interplay between microscopic details and macroscopic behavior. This 
characteristic feature of  complex systems, where phenomena at diﬀerent scales are intertwined and 
inﬂuence each other 9, ﬁnds a natural expression within fractonic logic.

From a theoretical standpoint, fractonic logic oﬀers signiﬁcant advantages in modeling and simulating 
complex physical and computational phenomena, transcending the limitations of  conventional logic. It 
provides a powerful framework to describe systems where information or "particles" are inherently 
constrained in their movement. This oﬀers a more accurate and physically realistic representation for 
many complex physical and biological systems than traditional models that assume unconstrained 
propagation. The subextensive ground state degeneracy could provide a novel mechanism for robust 
information storage or processing that is sensitive to the topology of  the underlying system.5 This 
topological protection could lead to new avenues for fault-tolerant computing or memory, where 

information is inherently resilient to local perturbations. By providing a ﬁeld-theoretic description for 
quantum melting transitions and exhibiting restricted mobility due to unusual sets of  higher (e.g., 
dipole) moment charge conservation 7, fractonic logic oﬀers a richer physical language for 
understanding and designing complex phase transitions and emergent material properties. The 
existence of  a natural analogue of  Yang-Mills equations using the Frölicher-Nijenhuis bracket, where 
constraining it to be symmetric leads to fractonic behaviors 23, points to a deep mathematical 
foundation for this logic that extends beyond traditional Boolean algebra, enabling the description of  
more complex interactions.

Self-organization and emergence in Complex Adaptive Systems arise from simple local rules and 
inherently restricted information ﬂow.12 Fractons, by their very deﬁnition, are characterized by 

restricted mobility and subdimensional propagation.5 This is not merely an abstract analogy; it 
represents a direct, fundamental correspondence. If  information carriers within a computational 

system are designed to possess fractonic properties, then the 

computational rules themselves would naturally embody the principles of  self-organization and 
emergence. This implies that fractonic logic could serve as a "native language" for describing, 
engineering, and controlling emergent behaviors, rather than simulating them indirectly through 
complex algorithms on conventional architectures. This fundamental alignment with the physics of  

complex systems could lead to more eﬃcient, scalable, and perhaps even intrinsically "intelligent" 
systems, as their underlying logic mirrors the mechanisms of  self-organization in nature. The 
necessity of  fractonic logic stems from its potential to provide this direct, physically grounded 
computational paradigm for emergence.

Fracton phases exhibit a "subextensive ground state degeneracy" 5, which is explicitly described as 
"robust" and "sensitive only to the topology of  space".7 This topological characteristic is highlighted 
as being incompatible with traditional Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT) descriptions, 
signifying a novel property.7 This unique topological robustness suggests an inherent fault tolerance 

and a novel form of  information encoding within fractonic logic systems. Unlike classical digital 
systems where localized errors can easily cascade and corrupt information, the topological nature of  
fractonic degeneracy implies that information might be intrinsically protected against local 
perturbations. This could be a signiﬁcant advantage for building highly reliable and resilient computing 
systems, particularly for critical applications where nonlinear dynamics can lead to unpredictable and 
potentially catastrophic outcomes. It points to a unique form of  "information redundancy" that is 
topologically protected, oﬀering a new paradigm for secure and stable computation.

IV. The Foundational Layer: Fractional and Continuous Logic

To fully realize the potential of  fractonic logic, a foundational layer capable of  handling continuous 
and multi-valued information is indispensable. This layer is conceptualized as fractional logic, building 
upon the principles of  continuous and fuzzy logic.

Fractional semantics for classical logic introduces a multi-valued system where truth-values are not 
conﬁned to discrete 0 or 1, but rather span rational numbers within the closed interval .24 This allows 
for the representation of  degrees of  truth, extending beyond the bivalent nature of  classical logic to 

capture nuances between "complete truth" (1) and "complete falsity" (0).25 A deﬁning characteristic 
of  fractional logic is its unique input signal conversion mechanism. Input signals, typically at a "Log. 1" 
level in traditional logic, are converted within a resistive matrix into signals of  the "Log. 1/n" level, 
where 'n' denotes the number of  inputs. The additive sum of  the weights of  all these converted 
signals is precisely engineered to equal "Log. 1".27 This mechanism enables weighted inputs and 
facilitates the ranking of  signals based on their signiﬁcance.27 The logic operates via a threshold 
module that switches its output when the additive sum of  the signals at its input surpasses a speciﬁc 
switching threshold.27 This enables complex logical operations based on weighted sums, akin to the 
principles found in threshold logic gates.27

Comparing fractional logic with binary logic reveals its enhanced expressive power and 
representational richness, particularly for complex systems. The continuous range of  truth values () in 

fractional logic, as opposed to the binary (0 or 1) states, allows for the representation of  "partial 
truth," vagueness, and imprecision.25 This capability is crucial for modeling real-world phenomena 
where information is often inherently imprecise or uncertain, and where decisions are made based on 
degrees of  belief  rather than absolute binaries.26 The ability to convert inputs to "Log. 1/n" levels and 
to utilize priority inputs with varying weights (e.g., 2/3, 3/4 versus 1/3, 1/4) 27 provides a signiﬁcantly 
richer method for encoding information. This allows for graded signiﬁcance of  inputs, which is highly 
relevant for complex, multi-factor decision-making processes prevalent in nonlinear systems. Despite 

these fundamental diﬀerences in internal operation, fractional logic is designed to be fully compatible 
with traditional logic and shares the same set of  basic elements 27, suggesting a potential for 
seamless integration or gradual adoption. Furthermore, binary elements of  fractional logic, by 
employing a two-node structure (resistive matrix and threshold module), can replace a wide range of  
multi-input AND/NAND and OR/NOR logic elements, potentially simplifying and reducing the cost of  
manufacturing electronic products.27

The relationship between fractional logic, fuzzy logic, and continuous logic underscores their shared 
capacity to handle imprecision, partial truth, and graded reasoning. Continuous logic is broadly 
deﬁned as a system where the truth value of  a proposition falls within the continuous range , with 0 
representing complete falsity and 1 representing complete truth.25 Classical bivalent logic is shown 
to be a subcase of  continuous logic, as its truth value set {0,1} is a subset of  .25

Fuzzy logic, introduced by Lotﬁ A. Zadeh in 1965 with fuzzy set theory, is a prominent form of  many-
valued logic that deals with approximate reasoning.25 Similar to continuous logic, fuzzy logic 

variables can have a truth value that ranges in degree between 0 and 1, extending to handle the 
concept of  partial truth between complete truth and complete falsity.25 Fuzzy logic models 
vagueness and imprecise information, reﬂecting how humans often make decisions based on non-
numerical information.26 The commonality across these paradigms is the fundamental move beyond 
binary (true/false) to a continuum of  truth values, which is essential for capturing the nuances, 
uncertainties, and graded reasoning inherent in real-world nonlinear systems. Fuzzy logic has 
demonstrated signiﬁcant utility in control operations and handling imprecise information in complex 

adaptive systems, such as self-driving cars, where it enhances decision-making accuracy, navigation, 
obstacle detection, and adaptability to dynamic environments.26

An analysis of  the beneﬁts and current drawbacks of  multi-valued logic (MVL) in hardware design 
reveals a complex trade-oﬀ.

Beneﬁts of  MVL:

Reduced Interconnections and Chip Area: MVL can signiﬁcantly reduce the number of  
interconnections and overall chip area in VLSI designs. Using a base 'k' instead of  base 2 can 
divide interconnections by log2k, directly translating to higher chip density.2
Solution to Pin-Out Problem: MVL helps mitigate the "pin-out" problem, which refers to the 
physical limit on the amount of  data that can enter and exit a chip.30
Higher Processing Speed: By allowing more functional modules to be implemented on a single 
chip or wafer compared to binary implementations, MVL can lead to higher processing speeds. 
This speed advantage is also linked to the reduced interconnection issue.30

Reduced Crosstalk Noise: The use of  MVL can inherently reduce crosstalk noise within the 
chip due to fewer interconnections.30
More Powerful Digital Functions with Fewer Devices: While the logic process of  MVL is more 
complicated than binary logic, it is expected to be more powerful for implementing complex digital 
functions with a smaller number of  physical devices.30
Eﬃcient Silicon Use & High-Speed Arithmetic Operations: MVL enables more eﬃcient use 
of  silicon resources and circuit interconnections in arithmetic units.30 Furthermore, number 
systems like residue and redundant number systems, when combined with MVL, can reduce or 
eliminate ripple-through carries in addition and subtraction, resulting in high-speed arithmetic 
operations.30
Better Insight into Binary Problems: MVL can provide a new, deeper understanding of  binary 
problems when reﬂected back to a two-valued scale, oﬀering novel problem-solving 
approaches.30

Drawbacks of MVL:

More Complicated Design Techniques: The primary drawback of  MVL devices is that their 
design techniques are signiﬁcantly more complicated than those of  traditional binary logic 
devices.30
Higher Power Dissipation: MVL logic circuits generally exhibit higher power dissipation 
compared to binary ones, primarily because the voltage levels used in MVL are typically 
higher.30
Not Self-Restored (CMOS MVL circuits): Unlike binary CMOS circuits, CMOS MVL circuits are 
not inherently self-restored. This necessitates the use of  a level restorer circuit every certain 
number of  stages to recover and maintain signal integrity.30
Lack of Simple Encoder and Decoder Schemes: The absence of  simple and eﬃcient encoder 
and decoder schemes for multi-valued systems reduces the eﬀective usage and practical 
implementation of  MVL circuits in VLSI.30
Maintaining Distinct Voltage Levels: With the continuous decrease of  technology nodes and 
operation at lower voltages, it becomes quite challenging to reliably maintain three or more 
distinct voltage levels with suﬃcient intermediate voltage gaps under severe noise constraints.31
Complexity and Speed Limitations (Speciﬁc to Memristor-based MVL): As function 
complexity increases, the number of  operation steps in memristor logic also increases, leading to 
lower overall processing speeds.4 Speciﬁc implementations like MAGIC gates suﬀer from state 
drift and lack signal restoration, demanding higher circuit design requirements.4

The fundamental shift from discrete binary (0/1) to continuous truth values () in fractional, fuzzy, and 
continuous logic directly mirrors the continuous nature of  most physical phenomena.24 This transition 

is not merely a mathematical abstraction but a profound re-alignment of  computational principles with 
the analog reality of  the world. Furthermore, fractional logic's "Log. 1/n" input conversion represents a 
physically inspired, weighted aggregation of  inputs, which is more akin to how physical systems 
integrate diverse signals than the abrupt, discrete operations of  Boolean algebra.27 This indicates 
that fractional logic is a crucial 

enabling layer for fractonic logic. If  fractonic logic is to accurately model and interact with the 
continuous, emergent, and subdimensional behaviors inherent in physical systems, it requires a 
foundational logic that can natively represent these continuous states and their nuanced interactions. 

Fractional logic provides this necessary continuous semantic space, allowing fractonic principles to be 
expressed and computed more naturally and eﬃciently, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical 
physics and practical computation.

Multi-Valued Logic (MVL) oﬀers signiﬁcant beneﬁts, such as reduced interconnections, higher 
processing speed, and increased information density per signal, compared to binary logic.2 However, 
these advantages come at the cost of  more complicated design techniques, higher power dissipation, 
and inherent challenges in reliably maintaining distinct voltage levels under noise constraints.30 This 

clearly indicates a fundamental trade-oﬀ between expressive power and hardware complexity. For 
fractonic logic to transition from theoretical concept to practical viability, it must eﬀectively navigate 
and potentially redeﬁne this established trade-oﬀ. The unique properties of  fractons—speciﬁcally their 
restricted mobility and emergent subsystem symmetries—might oﬀer 

new ways to manage or even mitigate the traditional complexities associated with MVL. For instance, 

if  information is inherently localized or constrained in its movement within a fractonic system, it could 
simplify the "pin-out" problem or reduce crosstalk in ways not fully explored by generic MVL. This 
implies that fractonic principles could potentially alleviate some of  the traditional drawbacks of  MVL, 
leading to a more optimized and feasible balance between the powerful expressive capabilities of  
multi-valued logic and the practical constraints of  hardware implementation.

V. Engineering the First Language for Fractonic Logic

Engineering a language for fractonic logic necessitates a synergistic approach, integrating advanced 
hardware architectures capable of  handling continuous values with novel programming paradigms.

A. Hardware Architectures for Fractional/Continuous Computing

The realization of  fractonic logic fundamentally depends on underlying hardware that can natively 

process continuous or fractional values and support highly parallel, localized interactions. Several 
emerging computational architectures show signiﬁcant promise.

Analog Computing

Analog computers represent problem variables as continuous, varying physical quantities, typically 
voltages or currents.32 They function by implementing a physical model of  the system under study, 

designed to solve ordinary diﬀerential equations by generating voltages that behave like the physical 
or mathematical variables in the system.32 A key operational principle is their inherent parallelism, 
where individual circuits are dedicated to each feature or equation being represented, ensuring all 
variables are generated simultaneously.32 Computations occur in parallel and are, for practical 
purposes, instantaneous within the useful frequency bandwidth of  the computational units.32

The advantages of  analog computing include its capacity for massively parallel temporal integration 
of  partial diﬀerential equations 33, direct access to optical degrees of  freedom in optical 
implementations 33, and the potential for noise-resilient designs.33 Crucially, recent advancements 

demonstrate that analog networks can learn nonlinear tasks, such as XOR and nonlinear regression, 
without requiring a traditional digital processor, exhibiting emergent learning driven by local rules.34 

These systems simulate complex physical processes more naturally and eﬃciently than digital 
systems, which must discretize continuous phenomena.33

Historically, analog computers faced signiﬁcant limitations. They were often clunky, expensive, and 
less accurate than their digital counterparts.35 Modifying an equation required laborious physical 
reconﬁguration of  the machine.35 There is also a notable lack of  standardization in programming 
analog systems 36, and their physical size directly correlates with problem complexity, making them 
impractical for very complex problems.36 Furthermore, data represented by electrical signals makes 
them susceptible to electromagnetic noise and interference.36 Despite these historical drawbacks, 
the inherent continuous nature and massive parallelism of  analog computing are highly suitable for 
representing the continuous values and leveraging the intrinsic parallelism of  fractonic systems. The 
demonstrated ability to solve nonlinear integro-diﬀerential equations, particularly with the integration 
of  memristors, directly supports the complex, dynamic, and often continuous interactions 

characteristic of  fractonic matter.33

Neuromorphic Computing

Neuromorphic computing represents a computational approach explicitly designed to mimic the 
functioning of  the human brain, developing both hardware and software to simulate its neural and 
synaptic structures for information processing.18 It primarily utilizes spiking neural networks (SNNs), 
which are composed of  spiking neurons and synapses that possess programmable charge, delay, 
and weight values.20 These systems operate in an event-driven and asynchronous manner, with 
learning processes often being local and network topologies non-layered, mirroring biological brain 

functions.18

The advantages of  neuromorphic computing are substantial. It oﬀers signiﬁcantly high energy 
eﬃciency compared to conventional computers, a critical factor for scaling complex AI systems.20 It 
enables massive compute parallelism 20 and aims to overcome the Von Neumann bottleneck through 
on-chip or in-memory computing, where memory is closely intertwined with processing.3 
Neuromorphic systems can process continuous values through analog mechanisms, such as storing 
a continuum of  conductance values in memory devices.3

Memristors play a crucial role in neuromorphic applications.4 These two-terminal devices change 
conductivity based on applied voltage/current, enabling vector-matrix multiplication directly in memory 
(in-memory computing).4 They oﬀer non-volatile state retention and support analog and multilevel 
operation for continuous information processing, mimicking biological synapses.4 Memristors can 
also exhibit weight adaptation behavior similar to Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), making 
them suitable for unsupervised learning in SNNs.19

Despite these advancements, current analog neuromorphic devices are primarily suited for 
inferencing rather than training due to insuﬃcient accuracy in weight movement and durability issues 
for the trillions of  weight changes required during model training.3 Other challenges include 
memristor parameter variability, non-linearity of  current-voltage characteristics, limited conductivity 
range, and the "sneak current paths" problem in crossbar arrays.4 Nevertheless, the brain's principles 
of  localized, asynchronous, and continuous processing, which neuromorphic systems emulate, are 
highly analogous to the restricted mobility and emergent properties of  fractons. Neuromorphic 

architectures, particularly those leveraging memristors for in-memory computation, oﬀer a direct and 
energy-eﬃcient hardware path for implementing fractional and fractonic logic, especially for handling 
continuous state changes and localized interactions.

Optical Computing

Optical computing harnesses the unique properties of  light for information processing, presenting a 
potential shift from the established dominance of  electronic processors.38 The ultimate goal in this 
ﬁeld is all-optical computation, where data remains optical throughout the device, eliminating the need 
for electro-optical conversions during processing.39

The advantages of  optical computing are compelling. It promises signiﬁcantly higher energy 
eﬃciencies 38, oﬀers near latency-free, high-performance computing (HPC) 39, and provides easily 
scalable data bandwidth and parallelism.38 Light travels signiﬁcantly faster than electrical signals, 
allowing for faster data access and processing.38 Optical systems excel in parallel processing for 
extensive data handling, enabling simultaneous operations to eﬃciently manage massive datasets.38

However, a fully all-optical, general-purpose computer has not yet been achieved.39 Much of  the 
successful research in optical computing has focused on optical communication to enhance 

electronic computing through hybrid electro-optical approaches, rather than pure optical 
computation.39 Despite these limitations, the inherent parallelism, high speed, and energy eﬃciency 
of  optical computing could be crucial for simulating the complex, highly interconnected, and 
dynamically evolving states of  fractonic systems. Its ability to handle massive datasets eﬃciently 
aligns with the potential for high information density and complex interactions within a fractonic logic 
paradigm.

B. Programming Paradigms for a Fractonic Language

Developing a programming language for fractonic logic presents unique challenges, particularly 
concerning its continuous and multi-valued nature. The design techniques for Multi-Valued Logic 
(MVL) devices are inherently more complicated than those for binary logic.30 This complexity will be 
signiﬁcantly ampliﬁed when designing a full programming language that must abstract and manage 
continuous or fractional truth values and their intricate, often non-linear, interactions. The current lack 
of  simple encoder and decoder schemes for MVL 30 highlights a broader challenge in standardizing 
interfaces and operations for non-binary logic. A fractonic language would necessitate the 
development of  new, universally accepted standards for representing and manipulating its unique 
data types and operational primitives.

Deﬁning precise and consistent semantics for continuous or multi-valued truth values, especially 
when incorporating concepts like negation or logical inference, can be highly challenging.40 The 
nuances of  "partial truth" demand sophisticated formalisms to ensure logical consistency and 

predictability. Furthermore, the unique and often non-Von Neumann properties of  emerging hardware 
architectures (analog, neuromorphic, memristor-based, optical) necessitate a much tighter integration 
with language design. This implies a signiﬁcant departure from traditional software engineering where 
hardware is largely abstracted away, requiring the language to expose and leverage physical 
computational principles for optimal performance.33

To address these challenges, leveraging and extending existing logic programming paradigms and 
their continuous/fuzzy logic extensions oﬀers a promising pathway. Logic Programming (LP), rooted 
in formal logic, utilizes facts and rules to represent knowledge, with computation performed by 
applying logical reasoning.42 Languages like Prolog and Datalog are declarative and well-suited for 
knowledge-processing applications, providing a strong foundation for deﬁning relations and 
inferences.43

Fuzzy Logic Programming extends classical LP to handle approximate reasoning and fuzzy 
deductive database applications.44 Languages such as LIKELOG use fuzzy similarity relations and 
provide "degrees of  derivability" for computed answers, allowing for the retrieval of  results that are 
"similar" to a user's query.45 jFuzzyLogic, for instance, implements the Fuzzy Control Language 

(FCL), which standardizes fuzzy system programming and reduces boilerplate code, simplifying 
development.44

Continuous Logic Programming (CLP) is a framework proposed for integrating ethical reasoning 
into AI systems. CLP utilizes a dual-rule system, comprising strict and defeasible rules, and a moral 
preference relation to systematically handle uncertainty and resolve conﬂicts.46 CLP aims for 
enhanced transparency and explainability by relying on clear logical constructs, which is critical for 
complex decision-making in AI.46

Multi-adjoint Logic Programming is a general framework that extends positive logic programming 
by including a negation operator in the underlying lattice. It allows for the use of  several implications 
and general operators deﬁned on complete lattices within the bodies of  rules.41 This approach aims 
for greater generality and ﬂexibility in handling complex logical systems, particularly those involving 
non-monotonic reasoning.41 These existing paradigms oﬀer a rich theoretical and practical 
groundwork for developing a fractonic language.

A fractonic language must incorporate several key features to eﬀectively capture the unique 
properties of  fractonic systems and their relevance to nonlinear dynamics:

Native Support for Fractional/Continuous Values: The language must inherently support truth 
values and data states that exist within a continuous range (e.g., ) or as rational fractions, rather 
than being limited to discrete 0/1. This aligns with fractional logic's input conversion (Log. 1/n) 
and the continuous nature of  physical systems.24
Constructs for Restricted Mobility: The language must provide explicit primitives or 
mechanisms to deﬁne and enforce subdimensional movement for computational "agents" or 
information packets. This could involve specifying spatial constraints, directional biases, or 
interaction rules that inherently limit propagation to speciﬁc manifolds, analogous to fractons, 
lineons, and planons.5
Primitives for Emergent Behavior: The language should include high-level constructs that 
facilitate the deﬁnition of  local interaction rules from which complex global patterns and 
behaviors naturally emerge, without requiring explicit central control or pre-programmed global 
states.12 This could involve rule sets that dynamically adapt based on local information, echoing 
self-organization principles.
Dynamic and Adaptive Rule Sets: For modeling and controlling nonlinear systems that 
continuously change and evolve, the language must allow for rules and system parameters that 
can dynamically adapt over time. This draws inspiration from adaptive fuzzy inference systems 
28 and evolutionary algorithms.16
Explicit Handling of Uncertainty and Imprecision: Building upon the foundations of  fuzzy and 
continuous logic, the language should provide robust mechanisms for reasoning with partial 
knowledge, vagueness, and potentially conﬂicting information, perhaps through integrated 
degrees of  truth or conﬁdence measures.26
Hardware-Aware Constructs: The language should feature abstractions that map eﬃciently and 
directly to the parallel, asynchronous, and in-memory operations of  emerging neuromorphic, 
analog, and optical hardware. This implies a signiﬁcant departure from sequential, Von 
Neumann-centric programming models, allowing developers to leverage the physical properties 
of  the underlying hardware.

Consideration of  bio-inspired programming approaches is vital for managing self-organizing and 
adaptive systems within a fractonic framework. Swarm Grammars are conceptual "swarms of  
stochastic grammars" that can evolve to describe complex properties, with individual grammars 
interacting as agents following swarm intelligence rules.11 This concept could be adapted for a 
fractonic language to deﬁne evolving computational structures and emergent behaviors. 

Evolutionary Algorithms can be used at a meta-level to design or train Spiking Neural Networks 
(SNNs) by optimizing their parameters and structure over time.18 This meta-programming approach 
could be extended to evolve fractonic logic programs or even their underlying hardware architectures. 
Finally, 

Agent-Based Modeling, given the strong focus on localized interactions and emergent behavior in 
fractonic systems, provides a natural conceptual framework for designing computations where 
individual components (fractons, lineons, planons) interact locally to produce global eﬀects.

VI. Conclusion

The analysis presented in this report underscores the critical necessity of  fractonic logic as the next 
evolutionary step in the realm of  nonlinear system computing. The limitations of  classical binary logic 
and the Von Neumann architecture, particularly their struggle to eﬃciently model continuous, 
emergent, and highly interconnected phenomena, highlight a fundamental mismatch with the 
complexities of  the natural world. Fractonic logic, with its intrinsic properties of  restricted mobility, 
subextensive ground state degeneracy, and emergent subsystem symmetries, oﬀers a profound 
alignment with the principles of  self-organization and complex causality that deﬁne nonlinear 

systems. This inherent compatibility positions fractonic logic not merely as an incremental 
improvement but as a paradigm shift, capable of  providing a more native and eﬃcient computational 
substrate for understanding and interacting with emergent behaviors.

The foundational layer for this transformative leap is fractional and continuous logic, which moves 
beyond binary truth values to a continuum of  possibilities. This shift is crucial for representing the 
nuanced, imprecise, and graded information prevalent in real-world systems. While multi-valued logic 
in hardware presents design complexities and power dissipation challenges, the unique properties of  
fractons—such as their localized interactions and topological robustness—suggest novel pathways to 
mitigate these traditional drawbacks, potentially leading to a more optimized balance between 
expressive power and hardware feasibility. The inherent topological robustness of  fractonic systems, 
stemming from their subextensive ground state degeneracy, further promises a new paradigm for 
fault-tolerant and resilient computation, where information is intrinsically protected against local 
perturbations.

Engineering the ﬁrst language for fractonic logic will demand a tightly integrated hardware-software 
co-design approach. Emerging hardware architectures, including analog computing, neuromorphic 

systems (especially those leveraging memristors for in-memory computation), and optical computing, 
oﬀer compelling pathways for processing continuous values with high parallelism and energy 
eﬃciency. These architectures, by mimicking the brain's localized and asynchronous operations or 
harnessing the speed of  light, provide the physical substrate for fractonic principles. The development 
of  a fractonic language will necessitate extending existing logic programming paradigms, such as 
fuzzy and continuous logic programming, to natively support fractional values, restricted mobility 
constructs, primitives for emergent behavior, and dynamic, adaptive rule sets. Bio-inspired 
programming approaches like swarm grammars and evolutionary algorithms will be instrumental in 
managing the self-organizing and adaptive nature of  fractonic computations.

In conclusion, the transition to fractonic logic represents an inevitable evolution driven by the 
escalating demands of  complex nonlinear systems. By embracing a computational paradigm that 
mirrors the fundamental physics of  restricted information ﬂow and emergent phenomena, and by 
developing a language capable of  expressing these principles natively, humanity can unlock 
unprecedented capabilities in modeling, simulating, and ultimately controlling the intricate dynamics 
of  the universe, from quantum materials to artiﬁcial general intelligence. This endeavor promises not 
just more powerful computers, but a more profound understanding of  intelligence itself, whether 

natural or artiﬁcial.
